# Resources Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Stable reference materials that support your ongoing work across notes, MOCs, projects, and areas.

## What Are Resources?

Resources are:
- **Reference materials** you consult regularly
- **External content** that provides ongoing value
- **Curated information** that supports your knowledge work
- **Stable foundations** that don't change frequently

Unlike notes (which capture your thoughts) or MOCs (which organize your knowledge), resources are primarily external content that you've identified as valuable for future reference.

## Resource Characteristics

### Stability
- Content doesn't change frequently
- Provides consistent reference value
- Can be consulted repeatedly over time

### Support Function
- Enables work in your areas and projects
- Provides foundation for note creation
- Supports learning and development

### External Origin
- Created by others (documentation, articles, books)
- Official references (API docs, standards)
- Curated collections (cheat sheets, guides)

## When to Create Resources

Create resource notes when you:
- **Repeatedly reference** the same external content
- **Find valuable materials** that support your areas
- **Need quick access** to information you use regularly
- **Want to add context** to external references

## Resource Lifecycle

### Discovery
- Encounter valuable external content
- Recognize potential for repeated use
- Identify knowledge gap it fills

### Capture
- Create initial resource note
- Add basic description and access info
- Tag appropriately for discovery

### Development
- Add key information and highlights
- Connect to relevant areas/projects/MOCs
- Create quick reference sections

### Maintenance
- Verify links and accessibility
- Update with new versions
- Refine based on usage patterns

### Archive
- Move outdated resources to archive
- Update references in related notes
- Maintain historical context if needed

## Quality Indicators

Good resources:
- **Provide quick access** to information you need regularly
- **Have clear descriptions** of their value and usage
- **Connect well** to your areas and projects
- **Stay current** and accessible
- **Save time** compared to searching each time

## Integration with Knowledge System

### Resources Support Notes
- Provide source material for atomic notes
- Enable deeper understanding of concepts
- Offer examples and patterns

### Resources Inform MOCs
- Supply authoritative information
- Provide structure for knowledge organization
- Offer comprehensive coverage of topics

### Resources Enable Projects
- Provide implementation guidance
- Offer tools and utilities
- Supply templates and examples

### Resources Maintain Areas
- Keep knowledge current
- Provide ongoing learning materials
- Support skill development

## Tips for Success

- **Curate actively** - Remove resources you no longer use
- **Add context** - Explain why each resource is valuable
- **Keep accessible** - Ensure links work and content is findable
- **Connect liberally** - Link resources to the knowledge they support
- **Review periodically** - Verify resources are still current and valuable
- **Create quick references** - Extract key information for fast lookup

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Saving every interesting link (be selective)
- Creating resources for one-time use content
- Failing to add context about why it's valuable
- Not connecting resources to your knowledge system
- Letting resource links go stale without maintenance
- Creating resources that duplicate easily-findable information

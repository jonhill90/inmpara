# MOCs Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Organize related atomic notes into coherent knowledge clusters.

## What are MOCs?

Maps of Content are hub notes that:
- **Connect related atomic notes** around a common theme
- **Provide overview and context** for knowledge clusters  
- **Emerge naturally** from patterns in your notes
- **Enable navigation** through your knowledge graph

## When to Create MOCs

MOCs should emerge organically when you notice:
- **5+ related notes** on a similar topic
- **Frequent cross-references** between certain notes
- **Recurring themes** in your work or thinking
- **Natural groupings** that would benefit from overview

## MOC Structure Template

```markdown
# [Topic] MOC
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Type: Map of Content
Tags: #moc #[topic] #[domain]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences describing this knowledge cluster]

## Core Concepts
- [[Note 1]] - Brief description of key insight
- [[Note 2]] - Brief description of key insight
- [[Note 3]] - Brief description of key insight

## Subtopics
### [Subtopic 1]
- [[Related Note A]]
- [[Related Note B]]

### [Subtopic 2]  
- [[Related Note C]]
- [[Related Note D]]

## Patterns and Insights
[What you've learned by connecting these notes]

## Questions and Gaps
[What's still unclear or needs investigation]

## Related MOCs
- [[Other MOC 1]]
- [[Other MOC 2]]

## Potential Projects
[Ideas for actionable work that emerged from this cluster]
```

## Types of MOCs

### Topic MOCs
Organize knowledge around subjects:
- Azure Networking MOC
- Machine Learning Fundamentals MOC
- Personal Finance MOC

### Process MOCs
Document workflows and procedures:
- Incident Response Process MOC
- Code Review Workflow MOC
- Project Planning MOC

### Problem MOCs
Collect approaches to recurring challenges:
- Debugging Strategies MOC
- Team Communication Issues MOC
- Performance Optimization MOC

### Tool/Technology MOCs
Centralize knowledge about specific tools:
- Terraform Best Practices MOC
- Obsidian Workflows MOC
- Azure DevOps MOC

## MOC Development Process

### 1. Notice the Pattern
- Review recent notes weekly
- Look for recurring tags or topics
- Notice when you're frequently linking between certain notes

### 2. Create Initial MOC
- Start simple with basic links and short descriptions
- Don't overthink the structure initially
- Focus on gathering related notes in one place

### 3. Refine Structure
- Add sections and subsections as patterns emerge
- Include brief descriptions to provide context
- Note insights that come from seeing notes together

### 4. Evolve Continuously
- Update as you add new related notes
- Reorganize sections when they get too large
- Split into multiple MOCs when scope grows too broad

## Quality Indicators

Good MOCs:
- **Provide clear navigation** to related knowledge
- **Add insight** beyond just listing links
- **Have logical organization** that makes sense to you
- **Connect to other MOCs** appropriately
- **Evolve over time** as knowledge grows

## Common Patterns

### Hub and Spoke
One central MOC with specialized sub-MOCs:
```
Data Engineering MOC
├── Data Pipeline Patterns MOC
├── ETL Tools MOC
└── Data Quality MOC
```

### Overlapping Clusters
MOCs that share some notes:
```
Azure Infrastructure MOC ←→ DevOps Practices MOC
         ↓                           ↓
Terraform Patterns MOC ←→ CI/CD Pipeline MOC
```

### Hierarchical Topics
Broad to specific knowledge organization:
```
AI/ML MOC
├── Machine Learning Algorithms MOC
├── Natural Language Processing MOC
└── Computer Vision MOC
```

## Tips for Success

- **Don't force it** - MOCs should feel natural, not arbitrary
- **Start small** - Begin with obvious clusters, expand gradually  
- **Keep descriptions brief** - Links with context, not essays
- **Update regularly** - MOCs are living documents
- **Split when necessary** - Better to have focused MOCs than overwhelming ones
- **Cross-reference** - Link between related MOCs liberally

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating MOCs too early (before natural clusters form)
- Making MOCs too detailed (they become notes themselves)
- Forcing hierarchical organization when networks work better
- Creating MOCs for single notes or tiny clusters
- Abandoning MOCs after creation instead of maintaining them

*MOCs are where your knowledge transforms from collection to connection.*

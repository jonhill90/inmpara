# Archive Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Store completed, inactive, or outdated items to keep the active workspace clean and focused.

## What Goes in Archive?

The archive contains:
- **Completed projects** that have achieved their objectives
- **Inactive notes** that are no longer referenced or relevant
- **Outdated MOCs** that have been superseded or are no longer useful
- **Obsolete resources** that are no longer current or accessible
- **Historical areas** that are no longer active responsibilities

## Archive Principles

### Clean Workspace
- Keep active folders focused on current work
- Remove completed items from active view
- Maintain clear boundaries between active and historical

### Preserve Context
- Don't delete - archive for potential future reference
- Maintain relationships and connections where possible
- Keep enough context to understand archived items

### Enable Retrieval
- Organize archived items logically
- Use clear naming conventions
- Maintain searchability

## When to Archive

### Projects
Archive when:
- ✅ All success criteria have been met
- ⏹️ Project has been cancelled or deprioritized permanently
- 🔄 Project has evolved into something completely different
- 📅 Project completion was more than 6 months ago

### Notes
Archive when:
- 📰 Information is no longer current or relevant
- 🔗 Note hasn't been referenced in 6+ months
- ⚡ Insight has been superseded by newer understanding
- 🎯 Content was very specific to a completed project

### MOCs
Archive when:
- 🗂️ MOC has been restructured and replaced
- 🔀 Multiple MOCs have been merged into a new structure
- 📚 Topic is no longer active in your knowledge work
- 🎯 MOC was created for a specific project that's complete

### Resources
Archive when:
- 🔗 Links are permanently broken or redirected
- 📖 Content has been superseded by newer versions
- 🛠️ Tools have been deprecated or replaced
- 📅 Haven't accessed resource in 12+ months

### Areas
Archive when:
- 💼 No longer part of your role or responsibilities
- 🎓 Learning area has been completed or mastered
- 🎯 Interest has shifted to other domains
- 🔄 Area has evolved into something completely different

## Archive Process

### 1. Decide to Archive
- Regular review identifies archive candidates
- Clear criteria met for archiving
- Active workspace becoming cluttered

### 2. Prepare for Archive
- Extract any still-relevant insights to new notes
- Update links from other active content
- Create redirect notes if necessary

### 3. Move to Archive
- Place in appropriate archive subfolder
- Maintain original file structure when possible
- Add archive date to filename if helpful

### 4. Update References
- Remove from active MOCs and area lists
- Update any links in active content
- Note archival in related items if relevant

## Archive Organization

### By Year
Good for:
- Time-based retrieval
- Historical perspective
- Annual reviews

### By Category
Good for:
- Type-based organization
- Consistent structure
- Clear boundaries

### By Domain
Good for:
- Subject-matter organization
- Professional/personal separation
- Area-based grouping

## Retrieval from Archive

### When You Might Need Archived Items
- Similar projects arise
- Historical context needed
- Learning from past approaches
- Reference for new work

### Making Archives Searchable
- Maintain consistent tagging
- Keep descriptive filenames
- Include archive index files
- Use consistent folder structure

## Archive Templates

### Project Archive Summary
```markdown
# [Project Name] - ARCHIVED
Archived Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Original Completion: YYYY-MM-DD
Archive Reason: [Completed/Cancelled/Superseded/etc]

## Final Status
[What was accomplished or why it was archived]

## Key Outcomes
- [Major deliverable 1]
- [Major deliverable 2]

## Lessons Learned
[Key insights for future reference]

## Related Active Items
- [Any ongoing work that connects to this]

## Archive Contents
[List of files/folders included in this archive]
```

### Note Archive Index
```markdown
# Archived Notes Index - [Date Range]
Archive Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Reason for Archive
[Why these notes were archived together]

## Contents Summary
- [Category 1]: X notes
- [Category 2]: Y notes

## Potential Future Value
[When these might be useful again]

## Related Active Content
[Current work that might benefit from these archived notes]
```

## Review Practices

### Monthly Archive Review
- Identify candidates for archiving
- Clean up recent archives
- Update archive organization

### Quarterly Archive Maintenance
- Review archive structure
- Consolidate similar items
- Update archive indexes

### Annual Archive Assessment
- Major archive reorganization if needed
- Delete truly obsolete items
- Extract valuable insights back to active system

## Quality Indicators

Good archiving practice:
- **Keeps active workspace clean** and focused
- **Preserves valuable context** for future reference
- **Maintains organized structure** in archive
- **Enables easy retrieval** when needed
- **Follows consistent criteria** for what to archive

## Tips for Success

- **Archive regularly** - don't let completed items accumulate
- **Be generous** with archiving - better to archive too much than too little
- **Maintain context** - future you will need to understand what's archived
- **Keep it organized** - archive should be as organized as active system
- **Review periodically** - archives need maintenance too
- **Extract value** - pull insights from completed work before archiving

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Deleting instead of archiving (losing valuable context)
- Never archiving (cluttered active workspace)
- Disorganized archive (impossible to find things)
- Archiving too aggressively (losing still-valuable content)
- Forgetting to update references when archiving
- Creating archive and never maintaining it

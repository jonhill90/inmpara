# Notes Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Atomic notes that capture single concepts, insights, or findings.

## Principles

- **One concept per note** - Each note should focus on a single idea
- **Clear and complete** - Written in your own words, understandable weeks later
- **Unique identifiers** - Use timestamps or descriptive names for easy reference
- **Liberal linking** - Connect to other notes freely, don't overthink it

## Naming Convention

Use one of these approaches:
- **Timestamp**: `20250608T1540-azure-databricks-dns-issue.md`
- **Descriptive**: `terraform-key-vault-access-patterns.md`
- **Hybrid**: `20250608-terraform-state-backend-setup.md`

## Note Structure Template

```markdown
# [Clear Descriptive Title]
Created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
Tags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3

## Content
[Main content - your understanding of this concept/finding]

## Context
[Where this came from, why it matters]

## Links
- Related to: [[Other Note]]
- See also: [[Reference]]
- Part of: [[MOC Name]]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Any follow-up actions
```

## Content Guidelines

- **Write for future you** - Assume you'll forget the context
- **Use your own words** - Don't just copy-paste, synthesize
- **Include examples** - Concrete examples make concepts stick
- **Note the source** - Where did this insight come from?
- **Add tags liberally** - Help with future discovery

## Common Note Types

### Technical Findings
- Configuration discoveries
- Error solutions
- Code patterns
- Tool usage tips

### Insights and Ideas
- Connections between concepts
- New perspectives on problems
- Creative solutions
- Strategic thoughts

### Learning Notes
- Key concepts from reading
- Meeting takeaways
- Course insights
- Experiment results

## Processing from Inbox

When moving items from inbox:
1. **Expand and clarify** - Turn quick captures into complete thoughts
2. **Add context** - Why does this matter? Where did it come from?
3. **Link immediately** - Connect to existing notes if relevant
4. **Tag appropriately** - Use consistent tags for discovery

## Quality Indicators

Good atomic notes are:
- **Self-contained** - Make sense on their own
- **Actionable or insightful** - Provide value when revisited
- **Well-connected** - Link to related concepts
- **Tagged consistently** - Discoverable through search

## Tips

- Start writing before you feel ready - you can always improve later
- Don't aim for perfection - aim for clarity and usefulness
- Create notes liberally - better to have too many than miss connections
- Review recent notes regularly to spot connection opportunities

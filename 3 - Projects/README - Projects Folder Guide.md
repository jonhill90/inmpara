# Projects Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Actionable initiatives with clear outcomes that emerge from your knowledge work.

## What Makes a Project?

Projects in INMPARA are characterized by:
- **Clear objective** - Specific outcome you're working toward
- **Actionable tasks** - Concrete steps you can take
- **Defined scope** - Beginning, middle, and end
- **Knowledge foundation** - Built on insights from notes and MOCs

## When Notes Become Projects

Projects emerge when your knowledge work reveals:
- **Specific problems** that need solving
- **Opportunities** worth pursuing  
- **Skills gaps** that need addressing
- **Ideas** ready for implementation
- **Goals** that require sustained effort

## Project Sources

### From MOCs
- Patterns in your MOCs suggest systematic approaches
- Knowledge gaps reveal learning projects
- Repeated themes indicate areas needing attention

### From Note Clusters
- Multiple notes about the same problem
- Recurring references to potential solutions
- Technical investigations that need follow-through

### From Areas
- Ongoing responsibilities that need project-level attention
- Strategic initiatives in your domains
- Improvement opportunities in your workflows

## Project Types

### Technical Projects
Building, fixing, or improving technical systems:
- Infrastructure automation
- Tool development
- System migrations
- Performance optimizations

### Learning Projects
Systematic skill development:
- Technology deep-dives
- Certification preparation
- New domain exploration
- Experimental implementations

### Process Projects
Improving workflows and practices:
- Documentation systems
- Team processes
- Personal productivity
- Knowledge management

### Research Projects
Systematic investigation of topics:
- Technology evaluations
- Market research
- Proof of concepts
- Feasibility studies

## Project Lifecycle

### 1. Emergence
- Notice patterns in notes/MOCs suggesting actionable work
- Identify clear problems or opportunities
- Validate that this warrants project-level effort

### 2. Planning
- Define clear objective and scope
- Break down into actionable tasks
- Identify required resources
- Set realistic timeline

### 3. Active Work
- Execute tasks systematically
- Document progress and learnings
- Adjust scope and timeline as needed
- Maintain connection to knowledge foundation

### 4. Completion
- Deliver on success criteria
- Document lessons learned
- Update related notes/MOCs with new insights
- Archive or transition to ongoing area

## Status Management

### Planning
- Objective defined but not yet started
- Tasks being refined
- Resources being gathered

### Active
- Currently working on tasks
- Regular progress being made
- Primary focus area

### On Hold
- Temporarily paused
- Waiting for external dependencies
- Deprioritized but not abandoned

### Completed
- Success criteria met
- Lessons learned documented
- Ready for archive

## Connection to Knowledge System

### Projects Feed Back to Knowledge
- **New notes** from project work
- **Updated MOCs** with project insights
- **Resource creation** for future reference
- **Process documentation** for reuse

### Knowledge Informs Projects
- **Problem identification** from note patterns
- **Solution approaches** from MOC insights
- **Resource awareness** from existing knowledge
- **Context understanding** from related work

## Quality Indicators

Good projects:
- **Have clear deliverables** you can point to when done
- **Build on existing knowledge** rather than starting from scratch
- **Generate new insights** that feed back into your knowledge system
- **Match your current capacity** and constraints
- **Connect to your areas** of ongoing responsibility

## Tips for Success

- **Start small** - Better to complete small projects than abandon large ones
- **Document progress** - Regular updates help maintain momentum
- **Stay connected** - Keep linking back to the knowledge that inspired the project
- **Be realistic** - Scope projects to match your available time and energy
- **Learn publicly** - Share progress and insights to reinforce learning
- **Celebrate completion** - Acknowledge successful delivery

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating projects before understanding the problem
- Scope creep without updating timeline/resources
- Losing connection to the knowledge foundation
- Setting unrealistic expectations
- Abandoning projects without learning extraction

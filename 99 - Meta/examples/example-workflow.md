## Month 2: Resource Curation

As Jon's work in this area matures, he identifies valuable resources that deserve permanent reference:

### 5 - Resources Created

**azure-networking-reference.md**
```markdown
# Azure Networking Reference
Created: 2025-07-15
Updated: 2025-07-15
Type: Resource
Category: Documentation
Tags: #resource #azure #networking #reference

## Description
Comprehensive reference for Azure networking concepts, patterns, and troubleshooting. Combines official documentation with practical insights from hands-on experience.

## Key Information
### Private Endpoint Configuration
- Private DNS zones required for each service type
- VNet linking must be configured for DNS resolution
- Subnet delegation required for some services
- Network policies affect private endpoint functionality

### Common Private DNS Zones
- Storage: `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
- Key Vault: `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net`
- Databricks: `privatelink.azuredatabricks.net`
- SQL Database: `privatelink.database.windows.net`

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup storageaccount.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net

# Check effective routes
az network nic show-effective-route-table --ids /subscriptions/.../networkInterfaces/...

# Verify private endpoint connectivity
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName storageaccount.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net -Port 443
```

## Usage Context
Daily reference for infrastructure design and troubleshooting. Particularly valuable when configuring new services with private endpoints or diagnosing connectivity issues.

## Access Information
- **URL**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/
- **Local Copy**: /resources/azure-networking-notes.md
- **Last Verified**: 2025-07-15

- [ ] Subnet has adequate IP space
- [ ] Network policies configured
- [ ] Service-specific configuration applied

## Notes & Annotations
- DNS configuration is consistently the most challenging aspect
- Private endpoint IPs are dynamic and shouldn't be hardcoded
- Some services have special requirements (e.g., Databricks needs multiple endpoints)
- Regional pairing affects some private endpoint features

## Month 3: System Maturity

After three months, Jon has a mature area with completed projects ready for archive:

### 6 - Archive Usage

**completed-projects/2025/azure-private-endpoint-terraform-module/**
```markdown
# Azure Private Endpoint Terraform Module - ARCHIVED
Archived Date: 2025-08-01
Original Completion: 2025-07-20
Archive Reason: Completed successfully

## Final Status
Module completed and deployed to production. Successfully adopted by 3 team members for new infrastructure deployments.

## Key Outcomes
- Standardized private endpoint deployment across 5 Azure services
- Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes
- Eliminated DNS configuration errors in new deployments
- Created reusable pattern for future modules

## Lessons Learned
- Starting with one service (Storage) and expanding was the right approach
- Team feedback during development led to better usability
- Documentation is as important as the code itself
- Terraform testing tools (terratest) valuable for complex modules

## Related Active Items
- [[Infrastructure Testing Pipeline]] - Builds on patterns from this project
- [[Azure Kubernetes Private Endpoints]] - Next logical evolution

## Archive Contents
- Complete Terraform module source code
- Documentation and usage examples
- Test cases and validation scripts
- Team feedback and iteration notes
```

## System Benefits Demonstrated

### Knowledge Compound Growth
- **Week 1**: 3 isolated technical notes
- **Month 1**: Organized MOC revealing patterns and project opportunities
- **Month 2**: Successful project delivery building on accumulated knowledge
- **Month 3**: Established area generating ongoing value and new projects

### Bottom-Up Emergence
- Structure emerged naturally from content, not imposed top-down
- MOCs created only when patterns became obvious
- Projects identified from real knowledge clusters, not artificial goals
- Areas developed from sustained engagement, not arbitrary categories

### Cognitive Alignment
- Daily processing routine minimized cognitive load
- Weekly pattern recognition leveraged natural thinking style
- Knowledge connections discovered through usage, not forced
- System adapted to Jon's work patterns rather than constraining them

### AI Enhancement Opportunities
- **Capture**: Voice notes during troubleshooting sessions
- **Processing**: AI-suggested tags and links during note creation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Semantic analysis to suggest MOC creation
- **Project Management**: Automated progress tracking and dependency identification

## Scaling Indicators

After 3 months, Jon's INMPARA system shows healthy growth:
- **15+ atomic notes** in cloud infrastructure domain
- **3 active MOCs** organizing related knowledge
- **2 completed projects** delivering real value
- **1 mature area** generating ongoing learning and projects
- **5+ curated resources** supporting daily work
- **Clean archive** preserving completed work context

The system has become self-reinforcing: knowledge work generates insights that suggest projects, completed projects create resources and learnings that inform future work, and the entire cycle continues to compound value over time.

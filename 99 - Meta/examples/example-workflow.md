# INMPARA Workflow Example

A concrete example showing how knowledge flows through the INMPARA system using tool-agnostic semantic formatting.

## Scenario: Azure Infrastructure Learning

Jon is working on improving his organization's Azure infrastructure and wants to systematically capture and develop his knowledge in this area using INMPARA.

## Day 1: Initial Capture

### 0 - Inbox Captures
Jon captures various thoughts throughout the day in his inbox:

```
Quick captures in 0 - Inbox/:

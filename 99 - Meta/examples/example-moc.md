# Azure Infrastructure MOC

## Overview
Central knowledge hub for Azure infrastructure patterns, automation, and troubleshooting developed through hands-on enterprise implementation experience. Focuses on practical patterns that work at scale with compliance and security requirements.

## Core Concepts
- [[Azure Databricks Private Endpoint DNS Configuration]] - Critical DNS patterns for private connectivity
- [[Terraform State Management Recovery Procedures]] - State file corruption recovery and prevention
- [[Azure Arc Hybrid Infrastructure Management]] - Extending Azure management to on-premises resources
- [[Hub-Spoke Network Topology Implementation]] - Enterprise network architecture patterns

## Knowledge Clusters

### Networking & Private Connectivity
- [[Azure Private Endpoint DNS Configuration]]
- [[Azure Private DNS Zone Management]]
- [[VNet Peering Patterns and Limitations]]
- [[Network Security Group Design Patterns]]
- [[Azure Firewall Integration with Private Endpoints]]

### Infrastructure as Code
- [[Terraform Module Development Patterns]]
- [[Terraform State Backend Configuration]]
- [[Infrastructure Testing and Validation]]
- [[Azure Resource Manager Template Patterns]]
- [[GitOps for Infrastructure Deployment]]

### Hybrid & Multi-Cloud
- [[Azure Arc Server Management]]
- [[Hybrid Identity and Access Patterns]]
- [[Cross-Cloud Networking Strategies]]
- [[On-Premises Integration Patterns]]

### Monitoring & Operations
- [[Azure Monitor Configuration for Infrastructure]]
- [[Infrastructure Alerting and Automation]]
- [[Cost Management and Optimization Patterns]]
- [[Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity]]

## Observations
- [pattern] DNS configuration consistently emerges as the most complex aspect of private endpoint implementations #azure #dns #complexity
- [insight] Infrastructure as Code requires disciplined state management practices to prevent corruption and team conflicts #terraform #iac #team-practices
- [trend] Hybrid scenarios becoming critical for enterprise compliance, driving Azure Arc adoption #azure-arc #hybrid #compliance
- [limitation] Azure private endpoint regional availability affects architecture decisions #azure #regional-planning
- [capability] Terraform modules enable standardization but require careful design for reusability #terraform #standardization

## Relations
- connects_to [[DevOps and Automation MOC]]
- enables [[Cloud Migration Strategy]]
- supports [[Security and Compliance Framework]]
- part_of [[Enterprise Technology Architecture]]

## Emerging Patterns
Several patterns have emerged from connecting these infrastructure experiences:

1. **DNS-First Private Endpoint Design**: Successful private endpoint implementations start with DNS architecture, not network topology
2. **State Management Discipline**: Teams that establish remote state backends early avoid 80% of Terraform operational issues
3. **Hybrid Identity Prerequisites**: Azure Arc success depends on robust hybrid identity foundations
4. **Modular Infrastructure Patterns**: Reusable Terraform modules require more upfront design but pay dividends in consistency and velocity

## Knowledge Gaps
- **Multi-region private endpoint patterns**: Limited experience with cross-region private connectivity
- **Advanced Azure Arc scenarios**: Need deeper understanding of Arc-enabled Kubernetes and data services
- **Cost optimization automation**: Missing systematic approach to automated cost management
- **Infrastructure testing**: Lack of comprehensive testing patterns for infrastructure changes

## Potential Projects
Knowledge clusters suggest several actionable project opportunities:

- [[Standardized Private Endpoint Terraform Module]] - Automate DNS configuration complexity
- [[Azure Arc Pilot Implementation]] - Extend Azure management to on-premises servers
- [[Infrastructure Testing Pipeline]] - Systematic validation of infrastructure changes
- [[Hybrid Networking Reference Architecture]] - Standardized patterns for hybrid connectivity

## Related MOCs
- [[DevOps and Automation MOC]] - Overlapping CI/CD and automation patterns
- [[Security and Compliance MOC]] - Shared private endpoint and access control patterns
- [[Cost Management MOC]] - Infrastructure cost optimization strategies

## Key Resources
- [[Azure Well-Architected Framework]]
- [[Terraform Azure Provider Documentation]]
- [[Azure Architecture Center]]
- [[Azure Private Link Documentation]]

# Azure Databricks Private Endpoint DNS Configuration

## Content
When configuring Azure Databricks with private endpoints, DNS resolution becomes the critical integration point that determines whether the workspace can authenticate and connect properly. The private DNS zone must be correctly configured and linked to resolve internal Databricks endpoints.

## Context
Encountered this during compliance-driven private endpoint implementation for staging environment. Initial deployment succeeded but workspace failed to start with authentication errors pointing to DNS resolution failures.

## Observations
- [technical-finding] Private DNS zone `privatelink.azuredatabricks.net` is mandatory for workspace functionality #azure #dns
- [requirement] A-record must map workspace URL to private endpoint IP address #networking #configuration
- [issue] Corporate DNS forwarders can override private zone resolution causing connectivity failures #troubleshooting #dns
- [pattern] Databricks requires multiple private endpoints for full functionality (workspace + auth) #azure #databricks
- [insight] VNet linking order affects resolution precedence in hybrid DNS scenarios #networking #architecture

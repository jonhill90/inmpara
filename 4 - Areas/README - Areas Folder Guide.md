# Areas Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Ongoing responsibilities and long-term interests that require sustained attention.

## What Are Areas?

Areas represent:
- **Ongoing responsibilities** in your work or life
- **Long-term interests** you consistently engage with
- **Domains of expertise** you maintain and develop
- **Persistent themes** that appear across multiple projects

Unlike projects, areas don't have completion criteria - they require continuous attention and development.

## Area Characteristics

### Persistence
- Continue indefinitely
- Require regular attention
- Evolve slowly over time
- Don't have "done" states

### Breadth
- Encompass multiple projects
- Generate ongoing learning
- Connect to various MOCs
- Span different time horizons

### Responsibility
- Often tied to your role or identity
- Require maintenance and improvement
- Impact your effectiveness
- Align with your values and goals

## When to Create Areas

Areas emerge when you notice:
- **Recurring themes** across your projects and notes
- **Ongoing responsibilities** that need systematic attention
- **Knowledge domains** you consistently work in
- **Skills/expertise** you want to maintain and grow

- Strategic initiatives
- Improvement opportunities
- Problem-solving efforts
- Skill development

### Projects Inform Areas
- New capabilities
- Updated practices
- Refined focus
- Enhanced knowledge

### Areas Connect to MOCs
- Provide context for knowledge clusters
- Guide MOC development priorities
- Suggest knowledge organization

### Areas Influence Resource Curation
- Identify valuable references
- Prioritize learning materials
- Guide tool selection

## Review Practices

### Daily Check-ins (2-3 minutes)
- Quick status of critical items
- Immediate priorities
- Blockers or issues

### Weekly Reviews (15-30 minutes)
- Progress on active projects
- Upcoming priorities
- Resource needs
- Knowledge gaps

### Monthly Deep Reviews (1-2 hours)
- Strategic assessment
- Goal alignment
- Process improvements
- Learning evaluation

### Quarterly Planning (2-4 hours)
- Major goal setting
- Resource allocation
- Process overhaul
- Strategic direction

## Quality Indicators

Healthy areas:
- **Generate consistent value** in your work or life
- **Have clear boundaries** - you know what's in/out of scope
- **Connect to your knowledge** through MOCs and notes
- **Produce regular projects** that advance the area
- **Evolve gradually** based on learning and changing needs

## Tips for Success

- **Start with obvious areas** - don't force artificial boundaries
- **Keep the number manageable** - 5-8 areas maximum for most people
- **Review regularly** - areas need attention to stay healthy
- **Connect to your identity** - areas should align with who you are/want to be
- **Allow evolution** - areas should change as you grow
- **Balance breadth and depth** - don't make areas too narrow or too broad

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating too many areas (overwhelming)
- Making areas too narrow (should be projects instead)
- Making areas too broad (impossible to manage)
- Neglecting review cycles (areas stagnate)
- Creating areas for short-term interests (should be projects)
- Duplicating existing areas with slightly different names

*Areas are the persistent contexts where your knowledge and projects live.*

# Inbox Folder Guide


**Purpose**: Immediate capture of all thoughts, ideas, insights, and findings.

## Guidelines

- **Capture immediately** - Don't worry about formatting or organization
- **Keep it simple** - Quick notes, voice memos, screenshots, links
- **Daily processing** - Move items to `1 - Notes` within 24 hours when possible
- **No pressure** - This is a dumping ground, not a filing system

## What Goes Here

- Random thoughts and insights
- Meeting notes and observations
- Code snippets and error messages
- Interesting links and articles
- Voice notes and quick captures
- Screenshots and images
- Anything that needs to be remembered

## Processing

Items in the inbox should be regularly processed into:
- **Atomic notes** in `1 - Notes/`
- **Direct addition** to existing notes
- **Quick actions** if they're simple todos
- **Trash** if they're no longer relevant

## Tips

- Use whatever capture method is fastest (voice, text, photo)
- Don't spend time organizing here
- Review and empty regularly (daily is ideal)
- If something sits here for weeks, it's probably not important

*The inbox is your cognitive safety net - use it liberally.*
